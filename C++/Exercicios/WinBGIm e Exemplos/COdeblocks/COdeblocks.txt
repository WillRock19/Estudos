Lets get started:
First download WinBGIm from http://winbgim.codecutter.org/
Extract it.
Copy graphics.h and winbgim.h files in include folder of your compiler directory
Copy libbgi.a to lib folder of your compiler directory
In code::blocks open Settings >> Compiler and debugger >>linker settings
click Add button  in link libraries part and browse and select libbgi.a file
In right part (ie. other linker options) paste commands
-lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32
click Ok





WinBGIm error: redefinition of 'int right'


//The original declaration. Note that there are two "right" variables
void printimage(
    const char* title=NULL,	
    double width_inches=7, double border_left_inches=0.75, double border_top_inches=0.75,
    int left=0, int right=0, int right=INT_MAX, int bottom=INT_MAX,
    bool active=true, HWND hwnd=NULL
    );


So what I did is that, I simply changed one of the "right" (the later former one) variable to "top". That's it.


//The corrected code
void printimage(
    const char* title=NULL,	
    double width_inches=7, double border_left_inches=0.75, double border_top_inches=0.75,
    int left=0, int top=0, int right=INT_MAX, int bottom=INT_MAX,
    bool active=true, HWND hwnd=NULL
    );
